      %h3 We started Bucky Box to make it easy to run a successful local food delivery business.

  .row.voffset
    .col-md-8.col-md-offset-2
      Since 2011 Bucky Box has powered all manner of local food deliveries including vegetable box schemes, artisan breadmakers, community supported agriculture farming, food co-operatives, and recipe bag subscriptions.
      And everyday we're working hard to support more types of operations.
